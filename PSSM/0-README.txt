The file mmdb_6KFS.pssm_matrix.txt contains the PSSM that can be used as PSI-BLAST input.

This matrix in conjunction with a cutoff of 1e-20, and >90% length coverage converges in the refseq database at 7-8 cycles.

I downloaded the sequences as fasta files and they are in seqdump-structure-PSSM.txt and can be used as input for the Cn3D lecture on sequence-structure guided alignment.
